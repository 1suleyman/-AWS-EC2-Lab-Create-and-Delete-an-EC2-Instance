# -AWS-EC2-Lab-Create-and-Delete-an-EC2-Instance
In this lab, I practiced launching, configuring, and terminating an Amazon EC2 instance within the default VPC in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region. This hands-on session reinforced understanding of EC2 networking, key pairs, security groups, and lifecycle management from launch → running → termination.
